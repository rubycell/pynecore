## What is PyneCore?

PyneCore brings TradingView's Pine Script capabilities to Python through a revolutionary approach - it transforms regular Python code to behave like Pine Script through AST transformations, while maintaining the full power of the Python ecosystem.

Instead of creating another object-oriented wrapper or a new language, PyneCore modifies your Python code at import time, giving you the intuitive bar-by-bar execution model of Pine Script without leaving Python's rich environment.

## Key Features

- **Native Pine Script Semantics in Python**: Write familiar Python code that runs with Pine Script's bar-by-bar execution model
- **AST Transformation Magic**: Your code is transformed at import time to implement Pine Script behavior
- **High Performance**: Zero mandatory external dependencies with highly optimized implementation
- **Series & Persistent Variables**: Full support for Pine Script's time series and state persistence
- **Function Isolation**: Each function call gets its own isolated persistent state
- **NA Handling**: Graceful handling of missing data with Pine Script's NA system
- **Technical Analysis Library**: Comprehensive set of Pine Script-compatible indicators and functions
- **Strategy Backtesting**: Pine Script compatible framework for developing and testing trading strategies

## Quick Example

```python
"""
@pyne
"""
from pynecore import Series
from pynecore.lib import script, close, ta, plot, color, input

@script.indicator(title="Bollinger Bands")
def main(
    length=input.int("Length", 20, minval=1),
    mult=input.float("Multiplier", 2.0, minval=0.1, step=0.1),
    src=input.source("Source", close)
):
    # Calculate Bollinger Bands
    basis = ta.sma(src, length)
    dev = mult * ta.stdev(src, length)

    upper = basis + dev
    lower = basis - dev

    # Output to chart
    plot(basis, "Basis", color=color.orange)
    plot(upper, "Upper", color=color.blue)
    plot(lower, "Lower", color=color.blue)
```

## Innovative Concepts

PyneCore introduces several revolutionary concepts:

### 1. Magic Comment & Import Hook

Identify your scripts with a simple magic comment:

```python
"""
@pyne
"""
```

This activates PyneCore's import hook system which intercepts Python imports and applies AST transformations to recognized scripts.

### 2. Series Variables

Track historical data across bars, just like in Pine Script:

```python
from pynecore import Series

price: Series[float] = close
previous_price = price[1]  # Access previous bar's price
```

### 3. Persistent Variables

Maintain state between bars with simple type annotations:

```python
from pynecore import Persistent

counter: Persistent[int] = 0
counter += 1  # Increments with each bar
```

### 4. Function Isolation

Each call to a function maintains its own isolated state:

```python
def my_indicator(src, length):
    # Each call gets its own instance of sum
    sum: Persistent[float] = 0
    sum += src
    return sum / length
```

## Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install pynesys-pynecore

# With CLI tools (recommended)
pip install pynesys-pynecore[cli]

# With all features including data providers
pip install pynesys-pynecore[all]
```

> **Note for Windows users**: PyneCore requires timezone data that is not included in Windows by default. The `[cli]` and `[all]` installations automatically include the `tzdata` package. If you're using the basic installation and encounter timezone errors, install it manually with `pip install tzdata`.

### Building & Installing from Source

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Build the package
pip install build
python -m build
# Creates dist/pynesys_pynecore-<version>.tar.gz and dist/pynesys_pynecore-<version>-py3-none-any.whl

# Install in editable/dev mode (changes reflect immediately, recommended for development)
pip install -e .

# Install with all optional dependencies in editable mode
pip install -e ".[all]"

# Install with dev tools (pytest, pyright, etc.)
pip install -e ".[all,dev]"

# Or install the built wheel (fixed snapshot)
pip install dist/pynesys_pynecore-*.whl
```

To use PyneCore from another project on your machine, install it in editable mode by pointing to the source directory:

```bash
pip install -e /path/to/pynecore
# or with all extras
pip install -e "/path/to/pynecore[all]"
```

## Getting Started

### Create a Simple Script

1. Create a file with the `@pyne` annotation:

```python
"""
@pyne
"""
from pynecore.lib import script, close, plot

@script.indicator("My First Indicator")
def main():
    # Calculate a simple moving average
    sma_value = (close + close[1] + close[2]) / 3

    # Plot the result
    plot(sma_value, "Simple Moving Average")
```

2. Run your script with the PyneCore CLI:

```bash
# First, download some price data
pyne data download ccxt --symbol "BYBIT:BTC/USDT:USDT"

# Then run your script on the data
pyne run my_script.py ccxt_BYBIT_BTC_USDT_USDT_1D.ohlcv
```

### Working with Pine Script Files

PyneCore also supports running Pine Script files directly with automatic compilation:

```bash
# Run a Pine Script file directly (requires PyneSys API key)
pyne run my_indicator.pine ccxt_BYBIT_BTC_USDT_USDT_1D.ohlcv --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Or compile Pine Script to Python first
pyne compile my_indicator.pine --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Then run the compiled Python file
pyne run my_indicator.py ccxt_BYBIT_BTC_USDT_USDT_1D.ohlcv
```

> **Note**: Pine Script compilation requires a PyneSys API key. Get yours at [pynesys.io](https://pynesys.io).

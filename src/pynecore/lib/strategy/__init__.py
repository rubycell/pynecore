        ``open -> low -> high -> close``, see :meth:`process_orders`) and the
        trailing stop follows it tick by tick: the high/low-water mark advances
        on every favorable segment of the path — including the current bar's own
        extreme — and the stop sits ``trail_offset`` ticks behind it. The trail
        arms when the path touches ``order.trail_price`` (``entry ±
        trail_points``) and can fill on the SAME bar once the path retraces
        ``trail_offset`` ticks from the watermark reached after arming: a bar
        that pierces the activation level, runs on to its extreme and pulls back
        fills at ``extreme -/+ offset``, not at the activation level. With
        ``trail_offset == 0`` the stop sits on the watermark itself, so the fill
        lands at the activation tick (or at the open of a bar opening beyond the
        carried watermark).

        A bar that opens beyond a CARRIED stop (inter-bar gap) fills at the
        open; within the bar the path is assumed gapless, so fills land exactly
        at the trailed stop level. When the same order also carries a hard
        ``stop=`` leg that the path reaches earlier in intrabar time — before
        the trail arms, or at a less favorable level on the same falling
        segment — the trail defers to the price walk so the hard stop wins.
        Likewise a take-profit ``limit=`` leg reached on a favorable segment
        fires before any trailing fill on a later retrace, so the trail defers
        to the price walk there too (verified against TradingView references
        on BINANCE:ETHUSDT.P — TV fills the limit at its level, not the
        trailing stop at ``watermark -/+ offset``); only an offset-0 arming
        fill at a not-stricter activation level precedes the limit on the same
        segment.

        The walk is two-phase so it interleaves with the intrabar margin-call
        checkpoints in :meth:`_process_limit_stop_orders`: the default call
        handles the open tick and the legs up to the second extreme, persists
        the armed/water-mark state on the order and reports ``_trail_pending``;
        a ``close_leg=True`` call resumes from the second extreme and walks the
        final (extreme -> close) segment. A fill on that closing leg happens
        chronologically after a margin call at the adverse extreme, which may
        have already trimmed the position by then.

        A bracket its own entry activates partway through the bar starts at
        ``start`` -- the entry's fill price -- instead of the bar open, and only

        MEASURED (BINANCE:BTCUSDT 30m, 222 trades of a probe entering every 97th
        bar and issuing ``strategy.exit(trail_points=50, trail_offset=10)`` from
        inside ``if strategy.position_size > 0``): the mark anchors to the issue
        bar's CLOSE tick, NOT to its extreme. Folding the entry-fill bar's H/L in
        puts the stop above the next bar's open, which then gaps through and fills
        at that open -- 106 of the 222 exits land on the wrong price that way,
        zero with the close anchor. The same anchor was already verified for a
        changed-params re-issue (per-bar ``atr*mult`` trail): a long re-issue
        filled at ``next open - offset`` (open above close, mark advanced) and a
        short re-issue at ``close + offset`` (open above close, mark kept).

        Exits placed on the entry SIGNAL bar (entry still pending, so no bound
        trade is open yet) are skipped: ``process_orders`` seeds those on their
        fill bar from the fill price onward (``_activate_trails_on_fill``).

        Optional post-script pass that fills current-bar-submitted orders at the bar's
        CLOSE — enabled by `script.process_orders_on_close=True`.

        When the flag is set, orders placed during the strategy's bar calculation get
        an additional fill attempt at the bar close, instead of waiting for the next
        bar's open. This covers BOTH:
          - Market orders: trivially executable at close.
          - Limit/stop orders: executable when the close has reached/crossed the trigger
            price. (Non-current-bar limit/stop orders already had their fair shake in
            `_process_limit_stop_orders` during the H/L walk.)
        Tick-based exit orders submitted on the current bar (`strategy.exit(profit=...,
        loss=...)`) still carry raw `profit_ticks` / `loss_ticks` when their entry has
        not filled yet, so the close pass resolves them through `_resolve_tick_exit`
        first — the trigger check needs concrete `limit` / `stop` prices.

        Fill price in every case is `self.c` — price-based orders fill where their
        limit or stop price is hit on the close, with no trigger-price snap on the
        close pass. Slippage matches the rest of the engine: applied to market and
        stop-triggered fills, NOT to limit-triggered fills, which are guaranteed to
        fill at the limit price or better. `filled_by_type` is set on the
        triggering order so `_fill_order` can attach the right exit comment.

        Bookkeeping note: `_finalize_bar_pnl()` already ran in `process_orders()` for the
        same bar. Re-running it here would double-count `cum_profit` for already-settled
        `new_closed_trades`. Instead, we only settle cumulative stats for trades that
        close DURING this pass (`_settle_close_pass_trades`). For positions opened right
        at the close, the bar has no remaining H/L range — their per-trade `profit` /
        `max_drawdown_percent` are intentionally left for the next bar's
        `_finalize_bar_pnl()` to compute, when there will actually be a range to attribute.

# Account-currency conversion
#
# TradingView converts a strategy's money at the CASH-FLOW level: every amount is
# multiplied by the rate of the day it is booked on, and nothing re-marks afterwards.
# Measured on BINANCE:BTCUSDT against currency.JPY (18.4% rate amplitude): a closed
# trade's profit is gross * rate(exit) - percent_commission_entry * rate(entry) -
# percent_commission_exit * rate(exit), 274/274 trades, worst 1.1e-7 relative.
#
# Every money quantity in this engine is `<something> * syminfo.pointvalue`, so folding
# the rate into the point value reproduces that automatically -- the entry commission is
# computed on the entry bar and the exit legs on the exit bar, each with its own rate,
# with no per-trade rate stored anywhere. It also keeps the percent metrics right: they
# divide two converted amounts, so the rate cancels, exactly as TradingView reports.
#
# The two exceptions are deliberate and measured:
# * cash_per_contract / cash_per_order amounts are already in the account currency and
#   are booked verbatim (584/584 each) -- they carry no point value, so they are
#   untouched by construction.
# * initial_capital is declared in the account currency, so it is never converted.

# The rate is a daily series but every money expression reads it, so it is sampled once
# per bar. Three forms are kept: the raw value the Pine builtins must return (na when
# there is no rate data), the safe multiplier the ledger uses (an unusable rate degrades
# to 1.0, which leaves an unconverted run bit-identical), and the scaled point value.

    """Apply TV's big-money sizing and margin gate to a money-sized entry.

    From 1e7 account-currency units of order money upward (equivalently 1e9
    ticks at mintick 0.01; the gate is bracketed in (9.0e6, 1.01e7] and is
    indistinguishable between the two at mintick 0.01) TV re-judges the
    floor-sized quantity: when the truncated money tick count reaches one
    grid unit below the NEXT lot's quantized cost, the gate is evaluated at
    that larger size (which its own cost then always exceeds, so the outcome
    is the parity branch: reject or fill the floor size); otherwise the gate
    runs at the floor size directly. See :func:`_gate_entry_lots` for the
    gate itself and the measurement provenance.

    The budget itself is quantized at the sizing source for every magnitude:
    ``_default_entry_qty`` floors from ``_sig10_money(money)``, whose
    10-significant-digit decimal grid reproduces every snap edge measured
    below 1e7 by one-shot equity-injection sweeps on BINANCE:BTCUSDT 30m (the
    0.05-tick edges of the 2026-07-08 cost cluster at [1e8, 1.16e8] ticks
    including the 1.25e8 ON point the band model could not map, and the
    0.005-tick Fabio Pro Scalper bisection edge at money ticks
    12451249.295 on 2026-07-10) as half of that decimal grid in ticks, and it
    carries the four big-money sizing events of the wild corpus script
    `Fractal Breakout Strategy [KL]` (5% of a 1e9 account, so 5e7 of budget)
    that the raw quotient misses -- three one-lot snaps on 2025-03-11 05:30,
    2026-01-31 08:00 and 2026-03-29 10:00, plus the 2026-08-25 18:30 entry
    whose raw budget lands 0.05 tick under its own cost ceiling and which
    TradingView fills at the full 632.93356 contracts.

    A quantized size then faces the ordinary
    creation-time margin check at the placement close: at 100%
    percent_of_equity sizing the snapped cost always exceeds equity, so the
    entry cancels at placement even when the fill open would fit (measured:
    the Gaussian Channel razor cancel and the 2025-01-02 19:30 flat100 probe
    cancel, where the open HAD gapped down far enough) — which is how the
    Gaussian Channel corpus divergence resolves. Above 1e7 that check is the
    big-money gate itself, and a reversal it rejects keeps its closing leg
    (see :func:`_suppress_opening_leg`).

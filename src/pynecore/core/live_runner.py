"""
Async/sync bridge for live data streaming.

Runs a LiveProviderPlugin's async watch_ohlcv() in a background thread
and yields OHLCV objects to the synchronous ScriptRunner via queue.Queue.

Serial startup: ``live_ohlcv_generator()`` starts the background thread
**and blocks until ``provider.connect()`` succeeds** before returning.
This guarantees that by the time the caller starts consuming the warmup
(local OHLCV file), the WS subscription is already active — any bar that
closes while warmup is running goes into ``bar_queue`` and cannot be
lost. A parallel-start design is appealing on paper but in practice
``provider.connect()`` (REST session + activity-cursor recovery + WS
handshake + subscribe) is slow enough that warmup of a local file
finishes first; the resulting gap means the very next bar close on the
exchange happens with no listener, and that bar is gone forever.

Catch-up: when the consumer first pulls from the live iterator (right
after the file iterator has been exhausted), any closed bars already
sitting in the queue are drained as additional warmup (the script_runner
historical loop processes them with ``barstate.ishistory=True`` and the
strategy still suppressed). Intra-bar updates queued during warmup are
dropped — they would otherwise inflate ``bar_index`` against a still-open
bar that the historical loop is not equipped to dedup. Once the queue
empties, ``LIVE_TRANSITION`` is yielded inline; the script_runner flips
to live mode and every subsequent bar runs against an unsuppressed
strategy.

Dedup: the duplicate-filter for ``last_historical_timestamp`` uses
**strict** less-than for both closed bars and intra-bar updates. The
plugin contract is that ``download_ohlcv`` returns fully-closed bars
only (the Capital.com plugin, for instance, drops the still-forming
last bar in its REST response), so under normal operation the
``ts == last_historical`` case does not arise. The strict-less filter
is kept as defense-in-depth: if a provider violates the contract or a
race serves an in-progress bar from REST, the script_runner live loop
treats the same-timestamp first live update as a continuation of the
last warmup bar — it seeds ``last_bar_timestamp`` from
``last_warmup_timestamp``, so ``bar_index`` does not double-bump and
the bar simply gets one more execution with the refined OHLC values.

    Bridge async watch_ohlcv() to a sync Generator[OHLCV, None, None].

    Spawns a background thread running asyncio, collects OHLCV objects
    via queue.Queue, and yields them including intra-bar updates.

    The background thread is started **eagerly** at call time, not on
    first ``next()`` — so the WS subscription is open during warmup and
    no bar is lost in the gap between the REST historical download
    finishing and the consumer reaching the first live update.

    The first batch of bars yielded after the consumer starts pulling is
    the catch-up: closed bars that landed in the queue while the local
    warmup loop was running. ``LIVE_TRANSITION`` is yielded inline once
    the queue empties, so the script_runner can flip to live mode at the
    correct point regardless of how long warmup took.

    :param provider: A LiveProviderPlugin instance (already configured).
    :param symbol: Symbol in provider-specific format.
    :param timeframe: Timeframe in TradingView format.
    :param syminfo: Optional symbol metadata used to gate idle-bar
                    synthesis and reconnect attempts on the trading-
                    session calendar. ``None`` (the default) or an
                    empty ``opening_hours`` preserves the legacy 24/7
                    behaviour where idle synth and reconnect fire on
                    every timeout.
    :param last_historical_timestamp: Timestamp of the last historical bar to avoid duplicates.
    :param shutdown_timeout: Max seconds to wait for graceful shutdown. 0 = wait forever.
    :param event_loop: Optional externally-owned event loop. When supplied, the background
                       thread runs the async loop on it via ``run_until_complete`` instead
                       of ``asyncio.run``. Required for broker mode so that the Order Sync
                       Engine can submit coroutines to the same loop.
    :param engine_event_stream: Optional coroutine (typically
                                ``OrderSyncEngine.run_event_stream()``) to run as a
                                long-lived task alongside the OHLCV watcher. The engine
                                receives its :class:`OrderEvent` stream this way.
    :param raise_on_connect_failure: When True, a ``provider.connect()`` that
                                fails fast during warmup is re-raised here, from
                                the construction call, instead of being buffered
                                for the first bar pull. Broker mode sets this so
                                the real connect error surfaces before
                                ``start_broker()`` can mask it with a generic
                                "live connection not established" reconcile
                                failure. Data-only callers (and the security
                                ``LiveBarStreamer``) leave it False and keep the
                                surface-through-the-iterator behaviour.
    :return: Iterator yielding OHLCV objects (both closed and intra-bar) interleaved
             with a single ``LIVE_TRANSITION`` sentinel marking the warmup→live boundary.

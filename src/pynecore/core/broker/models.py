    exchange orders (e.g. Bybit Partial TP/SL pairs), and only the plugin
    knows the mapping.

    **fill_qty is INCREMENTAL.** It is the quantity of *this* fill event,
    not a running total. :meth:`BrokerPosition.record_fill` *adds* it to the

    a plugin that reported ``fill_qty`` cumulatively across partials would

    it has already applied, as a final defence against a broker delivering

    broker-native execution id for that path (e.g. a cumulative-only
    reconcile/bridge emission); in that case the plugin MUST guarantee via
    its persisted ``filled_qty`` cursor that no other path re-emits the same
    execution. A ``None`` ``fill_id`` is a no-op for the gate (applied as-is),

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class PendingDefensiveClose:
    """Engine-side marker for an in-flight defensive close.

    Set by :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._handle_bracket_attach_after_fill_reject`
    BEFORE the defensive close dispatches; cleared by the engine's FILL
    handler when the close lands. While the marker lives, the entry
    intent stays in ``_active_intents`` so a same-bar
    :meth:`OrderSyncEngine.reconcile` cannot mistakenly classify the
    flat broker snapshot as an external flatten — see the
    ``defensive-close-pending-lifecycle`` design doc.

    Persisted to the parent entry's BrokerStore row under
    ``extras['defensive_close_pending']`` so a process restart between
    dispatch and FILL can replay the marker; the engine's startup
    replay then either drops the marker (FILL already recorded) or
    re-arms residual cancel handling.

    :ivar entry_id: Pine entry id this marker belongs to.
    :ivar close_intent_key: Diff key of the synthetic defensive close.
    :ivar close_order_ref: Broker-side order ref of the close, when the
        plugin returned one. ``None`` if dispatch ran but the plugin did
        not surface a ref (e.g. position-attached close on Capital.com).
    :ivar close_client_order_id: Canonical ``client_order_id`` of the
        synthetic close dispatch (derived from the close envelope). Set
        as soon as the dispatch is parked or returns — used to match the
        eventual FILL via :attr:`OrderEvent.order.client_order_id` when
        ``pine_id`` is absent and the parked order never appeared in
        :meth:`~pynecore.core.plugin.broker.BrokerPlugin.get_open_orders`
        (so :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._maybe_attach_defensive_close_ref`
        never backfilled :attr:`close_order_ref`). Also used to drop the
        parked pending row from
        :attr:`OrderSyncEngine._pending_verification` (and the persisted
        ``record_park`` row) once the close settles.
    :ivar pending_since: ``time.time()`` at marker creation. Drives the
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine.reconcile` stale-pending grace check.
    :ivar reject_context: Frozen snapshot of the
        :class:`BracketAttachRejectContext` that produced the close —
        used by startup replay to re-derive residual orders without
        rebuilding the exception.
    :ivar residual_cleanup_pending: ``True`` when the dispatch-time
        residual-cancel call hit a transient
        :class:`ExchangeConnectionError` /
        :class:`OrderDispositionUnknownError` and could not finish
        cancelling parent/TP/SL/partial-remainder orders. The next
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine.reconcile` replays
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._cancel_bracket_reject_residuals` so the
        residuals do not stay live until the FILL eventually arrives;
        cleared once the retry finishes (or on FILL-time settlement,
        whichever happens first).
    :ivar fill_observed: ``True`` once
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._route_defensive_close_fill` has matched
        the defensive-close FILL event (and seeded the in-memory
        duplicate-fill caches) but the final residual-cancel + audit
        sequence has not yet completed. Persisted so that a crash in
        the post-FILL settlement window does NOT lose the only record
        that the close already filled — startup replay re-seeds the
        duplicate-fill caches and routes the marker through the
        FILL-side branch of
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._retry_residual_cleanup_after_transient_fill`
        rather than waiting for a FILL that will never re-arrive.
    :ivar partial_filled_qty: Cumulative ``fill_qty`` already applied
        to :attr:`OrderSyncEngine._position.size` by no-FIFO
        defensive-close ``partial`` events. Set to zero on marker
        creation; accumulates as partials arrive. Used by the terminal
        ``filled`` event's missing/zero ``fill_qty`` fallback to derive
        the remaining close qty (``reject_context.qty -
        partial_filled_qty``) instead of re-applying the full marker
        qty (which would double-subtract the partial slices already
        accounted for).
    :ivar unapplied_partial_qty: Cumulative ``fill_qty`` from no-FIFO
        defensive-close events that the engine could NOT apply to
        :attr:`OrderSyncEngine._position.size` because the parent ENTRY
        fill had not yet arrived (``_position.size == 0.0``) — every
        ``partial``, plus the terminal event of a leg that leaves a
        fanned close INCOMPLETE (that parent is not neutralised, so its
        fill still has to be booked and reduced).
        Tracked separately from :attr:`partial_filled_qty` so
        the terminal computation does not believe the slice was
        already booked. When the parent ENTRY ``filled`` / ``partial``
        event finally routes through
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._route_event`, the engine subtracts the
        signed accumulated qty from :attr:`_position.size` and moves
        it onto :attr:`partial_filled_qty` so the terminal close FILL
        sees a consistent state. ``0.0`` on marker creation and after
        every drain.
    :ivar fill_exchange_order_id: Broker-side ``order.id`` of the
        actual FILL event observed by
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._route_defensive_close_fill`. Persisted
        alongside :attr:`fill_observed` so that startup replay can
        re-seed :attr:`OrderSyncEngine._settled_defensive_close_order_refs`
        with the fill id when the FILL arrived with an id different
        from :attr:`close_order_ref` (polled-orders fallback / broker
        rekey). Without persisting it, a delayed WS / polled-orders
        replay of the same FILL post-restart whose
        ``event.order.id`` differs from ``close_order_ref`` and does
        not echo ``close_client_order_id`` would slip past
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._is_duplicate_defensive_close_fill` and
        be re-applied to ``BrokerPosition``. ``None`` until the FILL
        is observed (or when the FILL event carried no ``order``).
    :ivar pre_close_position_size: Signed
        :attr:`OrderSyncEngine._position.size` captured at marker
        creation, before the defensive close dispatched. Used by
        startup replay to distinguish a broker snapshot that still
        reports the pre-close aggregate (close has not landed yet)
        from one that already reflects the close (close landed before
        crash but the FILL was not observed by the prior process —
        ``fill_observed`` would otherwise stay ``False``). Without it,
        the post-restart reconcile cannot safely adopt the broker's
        reduced-but-not-flat size into :attr:`_position.size` because
        the no-FIFO settle branch would treat the adopted size as
        pre-close and over-reduce when the delayed FILL routes.
        ``None`` only for markers persisted by an older schema; the
        replay path falls back to the conservative "skip adoption"
        behaviour in that case.
    :ivar fifo_closed_entry_ids: Snapshot of the entry ids whose FIFO
        ``Trade`` rows were closed by :meth:`record_fill` for this
        defensive close, accumulated across every ``partial`` /
        terminal ``filled`` event of the close sequence. The
        ``t == 'partial'`` branch in
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._route_event` merges each partial's
        FIFO closures here, and
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._route_defensive_close_fill` merges the
        terminal slice on top BEFORE the residual-cancel attempt — so
        in pyramiding (LongA closed by a partial, LongB closed by the
        terminal) both entries are persisted, not only the terminal's.
        Persisted so that
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._retry_residual_cleanup_after_transient_fill`
        can run the same FIFO-aware
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._cleanup_position_tracking` walk as the
        in-flight FILL path even when intervening
        :meth:`record_fill` calls have overwritten the live
        ``_last_fifo_closed_entry_ids`` snapshot. Empty when the FILL
        produced no FIFO closures (no-FIFO / degenerate path) or when
        the marker is replayed from an older schema; the retry path
        falls back to ``marker.entry_id`` in that case.
    :ivar expected_close_qty: Total quantity the close was actually
        dispatched for when the one-way emulator fanned it across more
        than one hedge leg, in PINE units (``CloseFanResult`` reports it
        as ``dispatched_qty``; its ``legs`` volumes sit on the broker's
        integer grid and are not comparable with fill quantities) and
        already net of a broker-holds-less shortfall. Each leg is
        a separate broker order with its own terminal event, so the
        first leg FILL proves nothing about its siblings: while
        :attr:`applied_close_qty` is short of this value the marker
        stays armed (and the shared parent identities stay out of the
        settled-duplicate caches) so a sibling that is later rejected
        still escalates. ``None`` for a single-order close — the
        marker then settles on its one terminal FILL as before.
    :ivar applied_close_qty: Cumulative close quantity the broker has
        reported against this marker — the single authoritative counter
        for fan completion. Every booked slice is credited when it is
        observed: ``partial`` events (which carry a leg's intermediate
        segments), terminal ``filled`` events, and slices deferred on
        :attr:`unapplied_partial_qty` while the parent entry fill is
        still missing (the later drain does NOT credit them again). A
        slice the engine drops without booking anything (the
        ``record_fill`` gate of positive qty AND price on the FIFO path,
        a zero-qty event on the no-FIFO path) is NOT credited, so a short
        total keeps the marker armed.
    :ivar settled_leg_order_ids: Broker-side ``order.id`` of every fan
        leg whose FILL was already applied to this marker. Only
        populated for a fanned close (``expected_close_qty is not
        None``), where the shared parent identities must stay OUT of the
        settled-duplicate caches until the last leg lands — so the only
        durable per-leg dedup identity is the leg's own order id.
        Startup replay seeds
        :attr:`OrderSyncEngine._settled_defensive_close_order_refs` from
        this tuple for an incomplete fan, keeping a delayed WS /
        polled-orders replay of an already-applied leg out of
        :meth:`BrokerPosition.record_fill` while the remaining legs are
        still outstanding.
    :ivar expected_leg_count: Number of legs the fan actually dispatched
        (``len(CloseFanResult.legs)``), ``0`` for a single-order close.
        A second, quantity-independent completion signal for
        :attr:`expected_close_qty`: that value is the PINE-unit plan sum,
        while the broker executes the plan snapped to its own integer
        volume grid, so the fills can total slightly less than the plan
        (a floor-style quantizer drops the sub-grid remainder). The
        quantity check alone would then never be satisfied and the marker
        would stay armed to the stale grace even though every dispatched
        leg filled. Once :attr:`settled_leg_order_ids` reaches this count
        every dispatched leg has reported its terminal FILL, so the fan is
        complete regardless of the residual quantity difference.
    :ivar booked_leg_count: How many fan legs have reported a terminal
        event that actually BOOKED quantity against this marker. Compared
        with :attr:`expected_leg_count` by
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._is_defensive_close_fan_incomplete`. Legs
        whose terminal event carried no quantity are deliberately NOT
        counted: they say nothing about the outstanding sibling quantity
        the marker exists to protect.
    :ivar dropped_close_qty: Cumulative close quantity the broker reported
        but the engine could NOT book — a ``partial`` slice with positive
        ``fill_qty`` and a missing/zero ``fill_price``, which
        :meth:`BrokerPosition.record_fill` discards. Such a slice makes the
        local view short of the broker's real execution, and the leg-count
        completion signal cannot see it (every leg may still report
        terminally). While this is non-zero
        :meth:`OrderSyncEngine._is_defensive_close_fan_incomplete` therefore
        ignores :attr:`booked_leg_count` and falls back to the quantity
        signal, keeping the marker armed so the stale grace or the next
        reconcile escalates the divergence instead of silently retiring it.
        Only STILL-UNRESOLVED drops are counted: a corrected redelivery of
        the same execution subtracts its quantity again (see
        :attr:`dropped_fill_slices`).
    :ivar dropped_fill_slices: The still-unresolved drops behind
        :attr:`dropped_close_qty`, as ``(fill_id, qty)`` pairs. A dropped
        slice is NOT necessarily permanent: the engine deliberately keeps
        an unbookable fill's id out of
        :attr:`OrderSyncEngine._seen_fill_ids`
        (:meth:`OrderSyncEngine._is_duplicate_fill`) so the broker can
        redeliver the same execution with a corrected price, and that
        redelivery books the quantity after all. When it arrives, the
        matching pair is removed here and its quantity is subtracted from
        :attr:`dropped_close_qty`, re-arming the leg-count completion
        signal — without this the aggregate would stay positive forever
        and keep a fully settled off-grid fan armed to the stale grace.
        Slices dropped without a ``fill_id`` cannot be discharged (nothing
        identifies their redelivery) and are counted in the aggregate
        only, which stays conservative. The pairs also make the drop
        bookkeeping idempotent: a redelivered price-less slice with an
        already-recorded id is not counted twice.

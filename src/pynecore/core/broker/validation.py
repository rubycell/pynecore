    """
    Probe a broker plugin against the enforceable parts of the
    :class:`~pynecore.core.plugin.broker.BrokerPlugin` authoring contract.

    The abstract ``execute_*`` surface is small, but the real contract lives
    in docstring prose that a new plugin author can silently miss. This probe
    turns the machine-checkable subset into fail-fast startup errors:

    - **Override pairs** — a plugin that overrides
      :meth:`~pynecore.core.plugin.broker.BrokerPlugin.get_residual_orders_after_bracket_attach_reject`
      returns broker refs the engine hands back to
      :meth:`~pynecore.core.plugin.broker.BrokerPlugin.cancel_broker_order_ref`,
      whose default raises :class:`NotImplementedError` — the defensive-close
      recovery loop would crash exactly when it is needed.
    - **Capability declaration consistency** — every
      :class:`ExchangeCapabilities` field must be a :class:`CapabilityLevel`
      (a ``True``/``False`` slips through type checkers on untyped call
      sites); a supported ``watch_orders`` needs the method actually
      overridden; a NATIVE / PARTIAL_NATIVE ``amend_order`` claim needs at
      least one of ``modify_entry`` / ``modify_exit`` overridden (the
      inherited defaults are cancel+recreate, which the declaration denies).
    - **Idempotency floor** — ``idempotency=UNSUPPORTED`` means restart /
      timeout retries can double-fill; live trading is refused
      (:class:`CapabilityLevel` documents this rejection, this is where it
      is enforced).
    - **Client-id budget** — ``client_order_id_max_len`` must be an int of
      at least :data:`~pynecore.core.broker.idempotency.WIRE_CLIENT_ORDER_ID_MIN_LEN`;
      the wire-form client-order-id cannot stay deterministic-and-recognisable
      below that.
    - **Lifecycle** — with ``require_account_id=True`` the plugin must have
      populated ``_account_id`` during authentication *before* the broker
      storage derives the run identity from it; a silent ``"default"``
      would collide every run of the account.
    - **PositionPort surface** — a non-``None``
      :attr:`~pynecore.core.plugin.broker.BrokerPlugin.position_port` must
      carry the full port surface the core
      :class:`~pynecore.core.broker.one_way_emulator.OneWayEmulator` drives.

    Deliberately NOT checked: ``cancel_all`` capability vs
    ``execute_cancel_all`` override. A ``SOFTWARE`` ``cancel_all`` is
    legitimately delivered through the sync engine's diff loop as per-intent
    cancels with the default ``execute_cancel_all`` untouched (Capital.com
    does exactly this).

    Warnings flag legal but degraded setups the author should confirm are
    intentional; they must not block startup.

    :param plugin: The instantiated broker plugin to probe.
    :param require_account_id: ``True`` on the production ``--broker`` path,

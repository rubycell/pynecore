"""
End-to-end integration: :class:`OrderSyncEngine` × :class:`BrokerStore`.

These tests cover the full pipeline previously provided by the old
WS1.5 recovery layer, now via the unified SQLite-based storage:

- After a restart, the same ``client_order_id`` is produced for a live
  intent (by reading back the persisted ``bar_ts_ms`` anchor).
- Parked dispatches are recovered on the next sync from the
  ``get_open_orders`` view, without re-dispatching.
- ``record_complete`` actually drops the persisted row — a cancelled
  intent does not resurrect.
- Stale-run cleanup, triggered on the next ``open_run`` call, closes
  a previously crashed run (SIGKILL simulation).

Unit tests for the ``BrokerStore`` API itself live in
``test_029_broker_store.py``; here we only exercise the cooperation of
the two layers.

# === Capital.com plugin × OrderSyncEngine integration ======================
#
# The tests below stand up a real ``CapitalCom`` plugin (with the live
# ``_call`` method replaced by an in-memory response table) wired through
# the real ``OrderSyncEngine`` and ``BrokerStore``. Three end-to-end
# scenarios are exercised:
#
# 1. Entry → confirm → restart → ``deal_id`` ref survives.
# 2. POST-confirm timeout parks the dispatch, restart recovery promotes
#    the row to ``confirmed``, next sync's ``get_open_orders`` unparks
#    the envelope without re-dispatching.
# 3. Market entry + bracket exit in the same sync cycle — the Capital
#    plugin receives both envelopes and attaches the bracket to the
#    confirmed entry row.
#
# These complement the plugin-local unit tests (which stub REST at
# ``_call``) and the sync-engine-local tests above (which stub the broker
# at the plugin interface) by exercising both layers together.

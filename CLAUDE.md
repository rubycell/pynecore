## If you are running in a CLOUD SANDBOX (claude.ai/code, remote agent)

Only tracked files exist there. Consequences:

- **The pine2pyne transpiler installs from PyPI** — `pip install opencode-pine2pyne`,
  then `python -m pine2pyne in.pine -o out.py`. (Transpiled `.py` files are also
  committed next to every `.pine`.) Still NEVER `pyne compile` / `pyne run x.pine` —
  that is the CLOUD compiler and needs an API key we don't have.
- **OHLCV data IS tracked** in `workdir/data/` (force-added `.ohlcv` + `.toml` pairs:
  dnse VN30F1M @1/3/5/15/1D, dnsebroker @1/3/5, HPG 1D, a ccxt BTC sample, replay
  DEMO). Backtests therefore work offline in FILE MODE — pass the dataset name, e.g.
  `pyne run script.py dnse_VN30F1M_1`. Provider mode (`dnse:VN30F1M@1`) still needs
  API credentials and re-downloads, so avoid it in the sandbox. Note the tracked
  files are snapshots from the dev machine; a provider-mode run there rewrites them.
- **Credentials and the DNSE trading token are absent** → anything live (`--broker`,
  the L0 gate) is IMPOSSIBLE. What works offline: `pytest plugins/dnse/tests/`
  (incl. the fake-venue e2e), transpiling, and the staged probes in backtest/oracle
  mode over the tracked data.
- **The dev machine's memory/notes are absent.** The durable venue facts (cancel-ACK,
  no cascade, amend-500, GTD clamp, session phases) live in
  `plugins/dnse/testing/live_test/README.md` — read it before touching the plugin.

## Conventions (distilled from the dev machine's global rules)

- **Never delete** — move unwanted files to `backup/deleteable/` and untrack
  (`git add -A <path>` to stage the deletion); `backup/` is gitignored.
- **Back up before destructive commands** on files with uncommitted changes.
- **Verify you are testing NEW code** — editable installs must resolve to the repo
  (`python -c "import pynecore; print(pynecore.__file__)"`), not site-packages.
- **Fork policy:** `main` = upstream (PyneSys/pynecore) + a linear fork stack,
  maintained by REBASE, never merge. NEVER use GitHub's "Sync fork"/update-branch
  PR on this repo — it merges (and conflicts); upstream updates go through the
  worktree-rebase flow (scratch worktree, skip superseded fork commits, replay
  the feature branch, full suites vs a pristine-upstream control, land by
  reset + force-with-lease). Dist name is `opencode-pyneruntime`; the import
  stays `pynecore`.
- Tests use `__test_*__` naming (`pytest.ini`); full-suite runs need
  `--ignore=tests/t00_pynecore/ast/test_045_lib_import_normalizer_invalid_alias.py`
  (a `@pyne` file that self-triggers at collection — long-standing upstream)
  AND `--deselect tests/t01_lib/t04_math/test_009_math_log_correctly_rounded.py`
  (pre-existing upstream red since the 6.9.1 sync, 818b63a; pytest.ini carries
  `-x`, so without the deselect the run stops early and incomplete).

## Pine → Python: use the LOCAL pine2pyne transpiler, NOT the cloud API

To compile a `.pine` strategy to the `.py` that `pyne run` executes, use the
**local pine2pyne transpiler**. Do NOT use `pyne compile` or `pyne run script.pine`
— those call the PyneSys **cloud** compiler and require an API key we don't have
(`workdir/config/api.toml` is empty, and `PYNESYS_API_KEY` is unset).

pine2pyne is a separate repo with its own venv:

```bash
cd /home/mike/workspace/github/pine2pyne
.venv/bin/python -m pine2pyne /abs/path/to/in.pine -o /abs/path/to/out.py
# globs work too: .venv/bin/python -m pine2pyne "sample/pinescript/*.pine" -o workdir/scripts/
```

Then run the transpiled `.py` (no key needed):

```bash
cd /home/mike/workspace/github/pynecore
.venv/bin/pyne run path/to/out.py <data> [--broker]     # e.g. data: dnse:VN30F1M@5
```

Notes:
- The tracked `*.py` test strategies can be **stale** — after editing a `.pine`,
  re-transpile it (they were not regenerated automatically).
- `pyne run` auto-compiles a `.pine` via the cloud API — avoid it; transpile
  locally first, then run the `.py`.

## NEVER use `pyne run` with `--from` (CRITICAL)

Always run **without** `--from`:

```bash
.venv/bin/pyne run path/to/out.py dnse:VN30F1M@1 [--broker]    # correct
.venv/bin/pyne run path/to/out.py dnse:VN30F1M@1 --from -30    # NEVER
```

Why: in provider mode the warmup download **truncates and rewrites the shared
`.ohlcv` file** (`cli/commands/run.py:611`). A run with `--from -30` therefore
*destroys* the accumulated local history for that `(provider, symbol, timeframe)`,
leaving only 30 bars — the next run must re-download, and any deeper history is
gone. `--from` is data-destructive, not a read-only window.

It also silently starves indicators: warmup replays exactly the bars `--from`
fetched (no lookback introspection — `max_bars_back` is a no-op stub), so
`ta.sma(close, 600)` under a small `--from` is `NaN`, every comparison is
`false`, and the strategy quietly never trades while the run looks healthy.

Omitting `--from` uses the built-in default (`-500` bars **requested**, gap-retried
up to 4×), which is safe for the cache. But it does NOT deliver 500 bars: measured
2026-09-10, `VN30F1M@15` warmup got **275 real bars of the 500 asked** — the window
spans ~27 days and the ATC/holiday slots inside it are empty. The venue is not the
limit (DNSE serves ~4,219 bars/year at 15m); the default's *window* is. So a strategy
using `ta.sma(close, 200)` starts with only ~75 valid bars.

If a script genuinely needs real depth, raise the default in code — pre-downloading
does NOT survive, because provider-mode warmup rewrites the shared `.ohlcv` (that is
the same mechanism `--from` abuses). Gate the strategy on `not na(<series>)` so
insufficient warmup fails loudly instead of silently. See #17.

## Plugins in this repo (`plugins/`)

Fork-specific venue plugins, editable-installed (so they import as
`pynecore_<name>`) and discovered via the `pyne.plugin` entry-point group:

- **`plugins/dnse/`** — DNSE (Vietnamese broker) plugin. Two entry points:
  `dnse` (`DNSEProvider` — OHLCV history + metadata) and `dnse_broker`
  (`DNSEBroker` — native STOP/OCO conditional orders). REST-only, built on the
  **vendored** DNSE openapi-sdk v2.0.0 at `plugins/dnse/pynecore_dnse/_vendor/dnse/`
  (do NOT pip-install the SDK). Run: `pyne run <out>.py dnse:VN30F1M@5` for data,
  `… dnse_broker:VN30F1M@5 --broker` for live orders. Tests: `plugins/dnse/tests/`
  — `pytest` with functions named `__test_*__` (see `pytest.ini`); mock via the
  fake-client seam in `conftest.py` — pytest itself NEVER hits the live venue.
  Live testing exists but is its own gated suite (see "DNSE testing" below). Docs mirror + sync tool:
  `docs/dnse-openapi-documentation/` (`fetch_docs.py`); plans in `docs/plan/`.

## DNSE has TWO order books — and a triggered conditional MOVES between them (CRITICAL)

Venue mechanic, operator-confirmed 2026-08-18:

- **Conditional book** — STOP / STOP-LIMIT orders. Ids are **long strings**
  (`da203hg6p09g1n1vipog`).
- **Normal book** — plain LOs for derivatives and stocks. Ids are **integers**
  (`437346`).

A stop order rests on the CONDITIONAL book until its TTL expires or its trigger
fires. On trigger the conditional order is **`Activated` — i.e. CLOSED, not
filled** — and the venue creates a **NEW order on the NORMAL book** which is what
actually executes. The activated conditional's detail carries metadata naming the
child normal-order id (`externalOrderId`).

**Consequence for the plugin:** a stop entry's fill NEVER appears on the id we
placed. Anything that maps venue records to Pine ids by the placed id alone goes
blind the moment a stop triggers — the strategy keeps believing `pos=0` while the
account holds a real position (measured live, Live-L3-F11 → issue #39; the OCO
exit path already tracks its child via `externalOrderId`, the stop-entry path does
not). When reading order state: `Activated` on the conditional book means *look up
the child on the normal book* — never treat it as terminal-without-fill.

## DNSE WebSocket testing rules — how the "silent WS" false verdict happened (CRITICAL)

Two venue facts were wrongly recorded as "WS is silent" for ~2 weeks because
probes were built from the DOCS alone. Rules (measured 2026-08-26):

- **The WS requires an explicit auth message within 30 s** (HMAC-SHA256 over
  `"{api_key}:{timestamp}:{nonce}"`); subscribes are REFUSED before auth.
  A probe that skips or fails this handshake sees "silent channels".
- **The connection path exists ONLY in the SDK, not the docs**:
  `wss://ws-openapi.dnse.com.vn/v1/stream?encoding=json|msgpack`
  (`_vendor/dnse/websocket/client.py`). Docs give only the base URL — a
  docs-faithful probe 404s.
- **Use the vendored `TradingClient`** (`_vendor/dnse/websocket/` — full
  client + AuthManager, subscribe helpers for every channel). Operator
  mandate: never hand-roll a WS client for production paths.
- **Event-driven channels (order./position.) prove delivery only when an
  account event occurs during the capture** — zero frames with zero account
  activity is the EXPECTED result, not silence (empty ≠ conclusive).
  Market-data channels (tick/quotes/ohlc) prove themselves in seconds during
  trading hours (measured: ~136 prints + ~650 quote frames per 30 s).
- **The engine's "WS connected and subscribed" banner is generic live-runner
  text** — for the REST-only DNSE plugin it prints WITHOUT any socket existing
  (`connect()` is a no-op). Never take it as WS evidence.
- Working probe: `plugins/dnse/testing/live_test/probe_ws_market_data.py`
  (`--trading` for order/position channels). Findings live on card #50.

## INVALID_TRADING_TOKEN on conditional writes is usually NOT a token problem (CRITICAL)

Measured 2026-08-24/25 (cards #46, #51): DNSE rejects VALID, in-TTL trading
tokens on **conditional-book writes** (place AND cancel) with
`400 INVALID_TRADING_TOKEN` — a 30-second-old token got the same rejection.
Both measured windows began right after the operator traded in the EntradeX
app; before that boundary the same token worked (T32 placed+cancelled a
conditional fine at 09:00). The token-mint flow itself (request → email OTP →
token, 8h TTL) has never been the failing part.

Rules:
- Do NOT re-mint on this error — re-minting was measured NOT to help (both days).
- `token_status.py` liveness stays GOOD through the breakage (its bogus-id
  probe dies at order lookup, before the deep check) — it is NOT a proxy for
  conditional-write ability.
- Schedule L0 and any conditional-book live work BEFORE the operator's first
  app trade of the day (pre-open ~08:20), or after they log out / go idle.
- During a broken window: cancels go through the operator's app; DAY orders
  expire at 14:45; do not keep retrying.

## DNSE venue toolkit — use it instead of hand-writing probes (CRITICAL)

`plugins/dnse/tools/venue.py` answers the questions every live session needs.
**Use it. Do not re-type a `DNSEBroker(...)` heredoc to ask them** — that habit is
what produced a false "account is FLAT" report on 2026-08-19 while the account
held +2 contracts: the improvised probe called `fetch_position`, which is a
CAPABILITY FLAG, not a method (the method is `get_position`), guarded it with
`hasattr`, and read the resulting `None` as "no position".

```bash
.venv/bin/python plugins/dnse/tools/venue.py status      # phase, token, position, orders
.venv/bin/python plugins/dnse/tools/venue.py flat        # exit 0 ONLY if truly flat+clean
.venv/bin/python plugins/dnse/tools/venue.py order <id>  # detail, auto book, history fallback
.venv/bin/python plugins/dnse/tools/venue.py cancel <id> # cancel AND verify terminal
.venv/bin/python plugins/dnse/tools/venue.py sweep --yes # cancel everything (destructive)
.venv/bin/python plugins/dnse/tools/venue.py history [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
```

**Exit codes are the point** — `0` answered affirmative, `1` answered negative,
`2` COULD NOT DETERMINE (the read failed). A failed read never looks like "flat".
Gate a live launch on `venue.py flat` rather than on anyone's summary.

Two behaviours worth knowing:
- **Phantom shells are separated from live orders.** A triggered conditional stays
  `Activated` on the STOP book forever while its NORMAL-book child does the work
  (#41), so it would otherwise make every post-fill cleanliness check cry wolf.
  `status` lists them as `phantom -> child N did the work`; `flat` ignores them.
- **`order` falls back to `/orders/history`** for previous-day ids, because the
  detail endpoint answers `None` for them (rows are date-prefixed, under `data`).

`sweep` cancels EVERY working order on the account, including the operator's own —
DNSE nets per symbol and the venue has no notion of "this run's" orders. Hence
`--yes`.

## DNSE testing (read before touching the plugin or running anything live)

Test cases are named **`Live-L<level>-<case>`** (e.g. `Live-L1-T11-OcaCancelMember`,
`Live-L3-F05-LongStopLimit`) — use ONLY these IDs in plans, cards and conversation;
the canonical registry with live status is the first table in
`plugins/dnse/testing/live_test/README.md`. The suite's rules are documented in
that same README — four types: `pytest plugins/dnse/tests/`
(unit + fake-venue e2e), the L0 venue-semantics gate (MANDATORY, exit 0, before EVERY
live run), the staged no-fill probe (T1–T13 + the `run_t10_dual.sh` dual-strategy
runner), and the staged fill test (F1–F8; its backtest mode over a past window IS the
oracle). Both staged probes are driven by `winStart`/`winEnd`/`startState` in their
`.toml` — for a live run `winStart` must be AFTER launch or warmup consumes the stages.
Grade live results from the VENUE record, never the run log alone. Measured venue facts
(cancel-ACK, no cascade, amend-500, GTD clamp, session phases) are listed in that README.
Trading-token workflow (OTP mint, ~8h TTL, status check): `plugins/dnse/tools/README.md`
— live runs need a GOOD token first (`tools/token_status.py`).

### Live-run session mechanics (Claude Code specifics)

- Background bash jobs die at ~10 min — a 1m staged run fits; 3m+ does not.
  Relaunch with `startState` to resume instead of stretching one job.
- Watch logs with `timeout N bash -c 'until grep -aq "X" f.log; do sleep 5; done'`
  — bare or chained `sleep` is blocked by the harness.
- Kill runs via `pgrep -f "live_[s]taged" | xargs -r kill` (bracket avoids matching
  your own wrapper shell). Exit 144 after your own kill is EXPECTED, not a failure.
- Raw `--broker` logs are ~500K ANSI spinner noise. Commit only stripped evidence:
  `sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g' f.log | grep -aoE '\[(L1|F|BROKER)\][^[]*' > f_evidence.txt`
  and park the raw log in `backup/deleteable/`.

## request.security() on DNSE — indices work, wired by symbol_map (not `--security`)

DNSE serves market INDICES (`VNINDEX`, `VN30`) on `/price/ohlc?type=INDEX` — ~1 year of
15m history, current to the session. The provider routes them via `_INDEX_SYMBOLS` (#104);
`type=STOCK` on an index answers 400.

The FRAMEWORK owns Pine-key → native-symbol translation (`script_runner.py` calls
`resolve_symbol`; all three official PyneSys plugins inherit it rather than implement it),
so a TradingView-style symbol is a CONFIG entry, never code:

```toml
# workdir/config/symbol_map.toml
[symbol_map]
"HOSE:VN30" = "dnse:VN30"
"VNINDEX"   = "dnse:VNINDEX"
```

With that plus the `.ohlcv` files, backtest AND live resolve with **no `--security` flags**.
Live warms up and streams each security in its own subprocess with its own provider instance.

Two things that look like feed bugs and are NOT:
- **No index bar at 09:00.** Derivatives ATO is 08:45–09:00, stock ATO 09:00–09:15, so index
  bars legitimately start **09:15** — `na` on the 09:00 futures bar is correct. (Backtest
  carries the prior close forward there; live reports `na` — they differ on the day's first bar.)
- **The 14:45 index bar is malformed at the source**: the auction close is published outside
  `[low, high]` with `O==H==L` (~0.5% of bars, all 14:45; futures unaffected). The provider
  widens the range and logs it; O and C are never altered.

## Pine behaviours that LOOK like bugs and are NOT (cross-checked on TradingView)

Measured 2026-09-10 after a long wrong turn — **do not re-investigate**:

- **`qty=1` everywhere can still leave `position_size = 2`.** When ONE bar crosses both a
  protective exit and an opposite-direction entry stop, the flip closes the position AND the
  still-armed exit fires as an *opening* order. **TradingView does exactly the same** (same
  probe, VN301! 15m). Not a PyneCore defect — it is inside TV-validated backtests too.
- **`pyramiding` IS enforced** by PyneCore, for market and stop entries alike.
- **Reversal sizing is correct**: short 1 then long `qty=1` → **+1** (not +2, not 0).
- **Do NOT try to cap size by guarding entries on `strategy.position_size`.** Order commit is
  deferred and stop entries fill intrabar, so the guard reads a stale `0`. Measured: it made
  things WORSE (2 → 3 contracts). A hard size ceiling can only live in the broker.

## Pine format strings: NEVER use a lone apostrophe

`log.*` / `str.format` follow ICU quoting — a single `'` opens a LITERAL section,
so `"the operator's close {1}"` drops the apostrophe AND prints `{1}` raw
(placeholders before it still work, so it looks like a partial bug). A balanced
pair (`close('T26') phase={0}`) is harmless — quotes are consumed cosmetically and
later placeholders still substitute. Escape a real quote as `''`. Measured
2026-08-19; symptom: literal `{n}` in a log line.

## Pine Script language reference

Authoritative Pine v6 reference (syntax, built-ins, `strategy.*` semantics):
https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/
Use it when writing test `.pine` files or checking what TradingView-compatible
behaviour SHOULD be (e.g. `strategy.exit` has no `oca_type`; exits form a reduce
group; OCA fires on fill, not on cancel).

## Reference repos (workspace siblings — read for patterns, don't edit)

Cloned next to this repo under `/home/mike/workspace/github/`:

- **`pine2pyne/`** — the local Pine→Python transpiler (see above); its own venv.
- **Official PyneSys broker-plugin samples** — the canonical examples the DNSE
  plugin's design was ground-checked against; copy their module split
  (`execution.py` / `activity.py` / `reconcile.py` / `recovery.py`), the
  `store_ctx` persistence + `DisappearanceTracker` patterns, and the
  `broker_lab/` conformance-lab `VenueProfile`:
  - `pynecore-plugin-bybit/` — native `reduceOnly`, bar-close fills
  - `pynecore-plugin-capitalcom/` — deal-id model, `recovery.py` reopen-on-retry
  - `pynecore-plugin-ctrader/` — cTrader

"""API flatten for the FILL tier — thin CLI over ``tools/flatten.py`` (#91).

Close-first, then sweep the bot's own protection (journal-rooted, read-only
attribution) so a flat account is never left with an armed entry-stop
(measured 2026-09-08, operator-caught). Foreign orders are reported, never
cancelled — the netting account is shared. No app involvement, so the #51
window never opens (operator decision 2026-09-07).

Exit codes (venue.py convention): 0 flat AND owned orders swept/resolved,
1 not flat / sweep unresolved, 2 could not determine.

Usage: .venv/bin/python plugins/dnse/testing/live_test/flatten_api.py [--dry-run]
